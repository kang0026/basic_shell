Assignment1 part2  Building a shell (The basic shell supporting both external and internal commands)

@ sudo code
Print out a prompt;
Read a line from the user;
Parse the line into the program name and an array of parameters;
Use the fork() system call to spawn a new child process;
The child process then uses the exec() system call (or one of its variants) to launch the specified
program;
The parent process (the shell) uses the wait() system call (or one of its variants) to wait for the child to
terminate;
Once the child (the launched program) finishes, the shell repeats the loop by jumping to 1.

@ Working features
1. recognizes the internal commands: exit, pwd, history and cd.
2. uses strtok_r() for parsing
3. fork() and execvp(), wait()
4. handles errors gracefully(No input, unkwown commands, errors)
5. supports pipe with pipe() and dup2() system calls
(test: cat textfile | gzip -c | gunzip -c | tail -n 10) 

@ To compile
1. make run / make clean
2. gcc my_shell.c -> ./a.out
